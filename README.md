# üêü XLMFISH Community Site Plan

## Overview
The XLMFISH Community site is a core part of **[xlm.fish](https://xlm.fish)** ‚Äî focused on **transparency**, **analytics**, and **community engagement** around the XLMFISH ecosystem.  
This section provides real-time visibility into community wallets, treasury activity, and liquidity pools, while serving as a foundation for future governance and interactive tools.

## üéØ Project Goals

1. **Transparency**
   - Publicly display treasury and community wallet balances.
   - Track inflows, outflows, and liquidity pool participation.
   - Build trust through accessible, verified data.

2. **Utility**
   - Provide useful insights into XLMFISH token metrics and ecosystem health.
   - Integrate with Stellar APIs for accurate and timely data.

3. **Community**
   - Central hub for updates, educational resources, and proposals.
   - Prepare the groundwork for community governance tools.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Direction

| Area | Stack / Approach |
|------|------------------|
| **Backend** | Symfony (PHP) for routing, templating, and API integration |
| **Frontend** | TailwindCSS (mobile-first) + Alpine.js or lightweight React components |
| **Data Fetching** | Python scripts (from [`stellar-scripts`](https://github.com/neocrex-xlmfish/stellar-scripts)) feeding cached JSON |
| **APIs** | Stellar Horizon API + StellarExpert API |
| **Charts / UI** | Recharts or Chart.js + ShadCN/UI or Flowbite components |
| **Design Priority** | Functional first, minimal, re-usable, and maintainable |
