### 1. Introduction: XLMFISH üêü

XLMFISH is a digital asset built on the Stellar network. While XLMFISH functions as the accounting and utility token for our ecosystem, the core identity of this project is that of a **blockchain tool and web application**. Our mission is to build the critical infrastructure that enhances liquidity and facilitates cross-chain solutions within the Stellar ecosystem and the broader Web3 landscape.

### 2. Tokenomics and Distribution üìä

The total supply of XLMFISH is **$1,000,000,000$ tokens**. Our tokenomics model is designed for transparency, ensuring the majority of the supply is dedicated to market stability and community access, essential for underpinning our functional tools.

*Note: We acknowledge that tokenomics is a work in progress as we finalize the full breakdown of our partner-contributed liquidity.*

#### Tokenomics Summary

The distribution breakdown below is based on verifiable on-chain data and the strategic allocation goals of the team.

| Allocation Category | Verified XLMFISH Amount | Percentage | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Liquidity Pools (LP)** | $662,389,545.88$ | $66.24\%$ | The entire liquidity provision across 46 pools on the Stellar DEX. The breakdown of this total is pending finalization. |
| **Community & General Circulating** | $237,610,455.12$ | $23.76\%$ | All tokens currently sold and held by the general user base via the Stellar DEX, Lu.Meme, and Lumos Launchpad. |
| **Founder/Team** | $99,999,999.00$ | $10.00\%$ | Held by the founder for project development and long-term incentives. This is verified on-chain at account: `GCNJRV4UCGE2A754GCDS4H2JTETV6HFD6TQSB5Z4A6NSRPQ6635IN4GU`. |
| **TOTAL** | **$1,000,000,000.00$** | **$100.00\%$** | |

### 3. Liquidity Profile and Strategy üåä

Our LP profile is complex and engineered to adapt to market conditions. The overarching goal is to eventually establish self-managed liquidity for XLMFISH and all future project tokens, ensuring a stable foundation for the utility of our software tools.

#### Liquidity Pool (LP) Breakdown

The $66.24\%$ Total LP is currently composed of the following key components:

| LP Component | XLMFISH Amount | Status | Strategic Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| LibreXLM Partner LP | $4,438,797.71$ | **Known Value** | Liquidity contributed by LibreXLM across the $yXLMFISH/XLMFISH$ and $LIBRE/XLMFISH$ pools, demonstrating cross-ecosystem utility. |
| **Lu.Meme Foundational LP** | **To Be Determined** | **Pending Data** | The initial, stable liquidity set up by our launch partner, Lu.Meme, in the base $XLM/XLMFISH$ pool. This is a foundational, stable component of the token‚Äôs distribution. |
| Team Managed LP | Remaining Amount | Pending Calculation | The liquidity reserved for future team-managed pools, designed for strategic market adaptation and eventually full self-management. |

### 4. Technical and Accessibility Standards ‚öôÔ∏è

We prioritize technical compliance and accessibility to foster user trust and seamless ecosystem integration.

#### Purchase Accessibility

XLMFISH is available for direct purchase through multiple established platforms on the Stellar network:

* **Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: Available for direct purchase against various assets.
* **Lu.Meme**: Trading is facilitated on this platform.
* **Lumos Launchpad**: Available through the launchpad interface.

#### Technical Compliance

We are committed to maintaining the highest technical standards:

* **`stellar.toml` Commitment:** We are committed to hosting a correctly configured and compliant `stellar.toml` file. This ensures our asset is accurately recognized, validated, and displayed by wallets and services across the Stellar network, underscoring our commitment to transparency and security.

### 5. Vision and Strategic Positioning üöÄ

Our identity is rooted in development. **XLMFISH is a dedicated Web3 developer entity focused on building the necessary tools for multi-chain financial interoperability, anchored in the Stellar ecosystem.**

#### Our Core Mission: Bridging Liquidity and Value

We recognize two key market gaps that our development efforts are designed to fill:

1.  **Stellar Liquidity Enhancement:** While the Stellar DEX is robust, the overall liquidity and depth, particularly in non-XLM and emerging asset pairs, can be fragmented. Our applications will focus on developing **next-generation automated market-making (AMM) strategies** and user-facing tools to drive deep, efficient, and sustained liquidity across the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX).
2.  **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** The future of finance is multi-chain. We see a significant opportunity to build **secure, user-friendly bridges and APIs** that connect assets and value flows between the high-speed, low-cost Stellar network (leveraging Soroban for smart contract logic) and other major blockchain networks. Our tools are designed to reduce the friction, risk, and cost traditionally associated with cross-chain transfers.

#### Ecosystem Fit

We align with Stellar's original vision of making finance open and accessible. By building highly functional, compliant, and easy-to-use tools, we aim to be a core contributor to the ecosystem's growth, driving capital efficiency and enhancing the overall utility of the Stellar network as a critical gateway for global payments and tokenized assets.
