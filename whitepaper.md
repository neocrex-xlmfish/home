### **1\. Introduction: XLMFISH üêü**

XLMFISH is a digital asset built on the Stellar network. While the XLMFISH token originated through a strategic partnership with Lu.Meme and serves as a **highly liquid, actively traded asset** and our foundational entry point into the market, our core identity is that of a **blockchain tool and web application developer**. Our primary mission is to build critical infrastructure that enhances liquidity and facilitates cross-chain solutions within the Stellar ecosystem and the broader Web3 landscape.

### **2\. Tokenomics and Distribution üìä**

The total supply of XLMFISH is $1,000,000,000$ **tokens**. Our tokenomics model is designed for transparency, ensuring the majority of the supply is dedicated to market stability and community access.

*Note: We acknowledge that tokenomics is a work in progress as we finalize the full breakdown of our partner-contributed liquidity.*

#### **Tokenomics Summary**

The distribution breakdown below is based on verifiable on-chain data and the strategic allocation goals of the team.

| Allocation Category | Verified XLMFISH Amount | Percentage | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Total Liquidity Pools (LP)** | $662,389,545.88$ | $66.24\\%$ | The entire liquidity provision across 46 pools on the Stellar DEX, demonstrating significant, active trading volume. The breakdown of this total is pending finalization. |
| **Community & General Circulating** | $237,610,455.12$ | $23.76\\%$ | All tokens currently sold and held by the general user base via the Stellar DEX, Lu.Meme, and Lumos Launchpad. |
| **Founder/Team** | $99,999,999.00$ | $10.00\\%$ | Held by the founder for project development and long-term incentives. This is verified on-chain at account: GCNJRV4UCGE2A754GCDS4H2JTETV6HFD6TQSB5Z4A6NSRPQ6635IN4GU. |
| **TOTAL** | $1,000,000,000.00$ | $100.00\\%$ |  |

### **3\. Liquidity Profile and Strategy üåä**

Our LP profile is complex and engineered to adapt to market conditions. Given the XLMFISH token's established market activity, our overarching goal is to eventually transition this and all future project tokens toward fully **self-managed liquidity**, solidifying our independence and stability.

#### **Liquidity Pool (LP) Breakdown**

The $66.24\\%$ Total LP is currently composed of the following key components:

| LP Component | XLMFISH Amount | Status | Strategic Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| LibreXLM Partner LP | $4,438,797.71$ | **Known Value** | Liquidity contributed by LibreXLM across the $yXLMFISH/XLMFISH$ and $LIBRE/XLMFISH$ pools, demonstrating cross-ecosystem utility. |
| **Lu.Meme Foundational LP** | **To Be Determined** | **Pending Data** | The initial, stable liquidity set up by our launch partner, Lu.Meme, in the base $XLM/XLMFISH$ pool. This is a foundational, stable component of the token‚Äôs distribution. |
| Team Managed LP | Remaining Amount | Pending Calculation | The liquidity reserved for future team-managed pools, designed for strategic market adaptation and eventually full self-management. |

### **4\. Technical and Accessibility Standards ‚öôÔ∏è**

We prioritize technical compliance and accessibility to foster user trust and seamless ecosystem integration. Notably, we possess the **in-house technical capability to mint and manage tokens** that adhere to the Stellar network's highest standards.

#### **Purchase Accessibility**

XLMFISH is available for direct purchase through multiple established platforms on the Stellar network:

* **Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX)**: Available for direct purchase against various assets.  
* **Lu.Meme**: Trading is facilitated on this platform.  
* **Lumos Launchpad**: Available through the launchpad interface.

#### **Technical Compliance**

We are committed to maintaining the highest technical standards:

* **Native Minting Capability:** Our team has the proven capability to issue new assets on the Stellar network with complete adherence to all technical standards.  
* **stellar.toml Commitment:** We are committed to hosting a correctly configured and compliant stellar.toml file. This ensures our asset is accurately recognized, validated, and displayed by wallets and services across the Stellar network, underscoring our commitment to transparency and security.

### **5\. The XLMFISH Philosophy: Bridging Web2 & Web3 üåê**

Our primary strategic differentiator is our team‚Äôs deep background in **Web2 application development**. We believe that the current barriers to mass adoption in the blockchain space are not technological, but philosophical‚Äîthe complexity of user interfaces, terminology, and fragmented experiences.

#### **The Commitment to User Experience**

The XLMFISH developer entity is dedicated to translating complex, powerful Web3 concepts into **intuitive and familiar Web2 user experiences**. This means:

* **Simplicity as a Feature:** Building applications where users can perform complex tasks (like managing AMM positions or executing cross-chain swaps) without needing to understand the underlying blockchain mechanics.  
* **Intuitive Interfaces:** Designing dashboards and tools that feel familiar to users of modern fintech or SaaS platforms, reducing the learning curve associated with interacting with decentralized finance (DeFi).  
* **Focus on Flow:** Prioritizing seamless user flows and clear feedback mechanisms, minimizing opportunities for user error that are common in less polished decentralized applications.

By focusing on accessibility and the familiar language of Web2, we aim to accelerate the adoption of our high-performance Stellar-based tools.

### **6\. The Core Mission & Strategic Goals üöÄ**

XLMFISH is a dedicated Web3 developer entity focused on building the necessary tools for multi-chain financial interoperability, anchored in the Stellar ecosystem. The XLMFISH token provides the necessary initial community and market depth for our broader strategy.

#### **Our Core Mission: Bridging Liquidity and Value**

We recognize two key market gaps that our development efforts are explicitly designed to fill:

1. **Stellar Liquidity Enhancement:** Our applications will focus on developing **next-generation automated market-making (AMM) strategies** and user-facing tools to drive deep, efficient, and sustained liquidity across the Stellar Decentralized Exchange (DEX).  
2. **Cross-Chain Interoperability:** We see a significant opportunity to build **secure, user-friendly bridges and APIs** that connect assets and value flows between the high-speed, low-cost Stellar network and other major blockchain networks. Our tools are designed to reduce the friction, risk, and cost traditionally associated with cross-chain transfers.

#### **Ecosystem Fit**

We align with Stellar's original vision of making finance open and accessible. By building highly functional, compliant, and easy-to-use tools, we aim to be a core contributor to the ecosystem's growth, driving capital efficiency and enhancing the overall utility of the Stellar network as a critical gateway for global payments and tokenized assets.
