3. Liquidity Profile and Strategy
Our LP profile is complex and engineered to adapt to market conditions. The overarching goal is to eventually establish self-managed liquidity for XLMFISH and all future project tokens.

Liquidity Pool (LP) Breakdown
The 66.24% Total LP is currently composed of the following key components:
LP Component | XLMFISH Amount | Status | Strategic Role
LibreXLM Partner LP | 4,438,797.71 | Known Value | Liquidity contributed by LibreXLM across the yXLMFISH/XLMFISH and LIBRE/XLMFISH pools, demonstrating cross-ecosystem utility.
Lu.Meme Foundational LP | To Be Determined | Pending Data | The initial, stable liquidity set up by our launch partner, Lu.Meme, in the base XLM/XLMFISH pool. This is a foundational, stable component of the token’s distribution.
Team Managed LP | Remaining Amount | Pending Calculation | The liquidity reserved for future team-managed pools, designed for strategic market adaptation and eventually full self-management.

Key Liquidity Points:
Diverse & Deep: Liquidity is distributed across 46 active pools, ensuring efficient, low-slippage trading, especially within core pairs such as XLM/XLMFISH and yXLM/XLMFISH.
Foundational Partnership: The initial launch and primary base liquidity were established through Lu.Meme, a stable partner whose contribution is essential to the token’s foundation.
Future Strategy: The team maintains a strategy of gradually transitioning the LP profile to a fully Team Managed LP over time, aligning with the long-term vision of establishing complete control and self-management for the liquidity of all our tokens.
